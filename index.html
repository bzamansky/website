        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi there!  My name is Batya Zamansky.  I've lived in New York City my entire life, with a brief excursion now to Ithaca, NY for college.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a student at Cornell University in the College of Arts and Sciences, class of 2017. My major is currently undeclared, but I planning on majoring in Information Science. I enjoy coding mainly because it allows me to build cool stuff (like this website!) and solve problems in ways I might not think of otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not coding or doing copious amounts of homework, I enjoy singing with the <a href="www.thechainotes.com">Chai Notes</a>, Cornell's Jewish-themed A Cappella group.  I also love reading and writing fiction, although I could definitely improve on my writing skills.  I also enjoy crafts such as knitting and crocheting, and have been known to crochet many, many stuffed turtles.
